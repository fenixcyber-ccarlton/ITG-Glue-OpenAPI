# IT Glue API Specifications and Clients

This repository contains the OpenAPI specifications for Kaseya's IT Glue API.

**IT IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED FROM THEIR MAIN API DOCUMENTATION BY THE PYTHON SCRIPT IN THIS REPOSITORY.**



The Python script, in turn, was created nearly entirely by ChatGPT o1-preview.

The script runs automatically daily from Github and will update the OpenAPI specifications in this repository with the latest changes from the IT Glue API documentation with a new commit.

**Try it out at [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)** and copy and paste the contents of the `itgapi.yaml` file in this repository.

This project has NO official affiliation with Kaseya or IT Glue. It is a personal effort to provide OpenAPI specifications for the IT Glue API.

Note to Kaseya: This would be much easier if you'd provide an OpenAPI specification directly. Please consider it.
